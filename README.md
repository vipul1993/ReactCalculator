A real time chat app powered by react and pusher chatkit api. The users can chat and commuicate with each other on real time basis and also have the facility to chat either on a 1:1 basis or on a public platform.

The app enables the facility to subscribe to various rooms(we can think of rooms as eihter watsapp groups if its public or a 1:1 chat if its peer to peer). 

THe app is made using react,webpack and babel and build as a personal project.It makes an extensive use of components, states and other such common core react features.The main thing which i got to know from this project is the bi-directional data flow of info in react components.

You can just clone this project by using the above link. Once the eepo is cloned type in the following commands to install the dependencies:

yarn install

Once the dependencies are installed just start the project by typing the following command:

yarn start

BOOM...!!! Now sit back relax and start chatting.
